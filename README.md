This is not a place of honour.

Wrote this to try and figure out the numbers that wore off my debit card. It doesn't work very well because it turns out that the check digit is 1 in 10. Which would make sense considering it's a single digits. Alas, I already wrote it. Maybe you'll find use in it.

This code is exactly as it is when I got it working. That's to say: messy and bad, sorry!
